# Junction 2024 Project: Fingrid Challenge

Welcome to **InsightGrid**, the Back-End submission for the Fingrid Challenge at Junction 2024! Our goal was to create an interactive tool that helps Fingrid suppliers and external users stay updated on the latest developments in Fingrid's Datahub platform.

## Key Features

- **Multifunctional Dashboard**: Aggregate data from various sources into a clear, digestible format for a comprehensive overview.
- **Collaborative Feedback**: Leave comments, receive feedback from other contributors, and connect directly with Fingrid.
- **Advanced Push Notifications**: Customizable alerts for new releases and feature request updates.
- **Release & Feature Request Lists**: Access lists of releases and feature requests with filtering options and linked features.

## Tech Stack
